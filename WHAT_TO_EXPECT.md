# What to Expect During Training

## üî¥ Before Fix (What You Were Seeing)

### Training Output:
```
Epoch 1/50
  Train Loss: 0.2500, Train Dice: 0.0100
  Val Loss: 0.2800, Val Dice: 0.0080
  Val IoU: 0.0040, Val Accuracy: 0.9960  ‚Üê High but meaningless!
  Sensitivity: 0.0200, Specificity: 0.9990

Epoch 10/50
  Train Loss: 0.2100, Train Dice: 0.0300  ‚Üê Barely improving
  Val Loss: 0.2600, Val Dice: 0.0250
  Val IoU: 0.0130, Val Accuracy: 0.9962
  Sensitivity: 0.0500, Specificity: 0.9991

Epoch 30/50
  Train Loss: 0.1900, Train Dice: 0.0500  ‚Üê Still terrible
  Val Loss: 0.2500, Val Dice: 0.0400
  Val IoU: 0.0210, Val Accuracy: 0.9963
  Sensitivity: 0.0800, Specificity: 0.9992
```

### What Was Wrong:
- ‚ùå Dice stayed near 0 (no lesion detection)
- ‚ùå IoU never improved significantly
- ‚ùå Sensitivity stayed <10% (missing 90%+ of lesions)
- ‚ùå Model was just predicting mostly zeros
- ‚úÖ Accuracy was high but **completely meaningless**

### Visual Predictions:
```
Input Image          Ground Truth         Prediction (BAD)
[Brain scan]    ‚Üí    [White lesions]  ‚Üí   [All black / almost nothing]
                                            ‚ùå Model sees nothing!
```

## üü¢ After Fix (What You Should See)

### Training Output:
```
Epoch 1/100
  Train Loss: 0.5200, Train Dice: 0.0800  ‚Üê Starting higher
  Val Loss: 0.5400, Val Dice: 0.0600
  Val IoU: 0.0310, Val Accuracy: 0.9955

### Visual Predictions:
```
Input Image          Ground Truth         Prediction (GOOD)
[Brain scan]    ‚Üí    [White lesions]  ‚Üí   [White/gray blobs where lesions are]
                                            ‚úÖ Model detects lesions!
```

## üìä Side-by-Side Comparison

| Metric | Before Fix (Epoch 30) | After Fix (Epoch 30) | Change |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Dice** | 0.05 | 0.52 | +940% ‚úÖ |
| **IoU** | 0.02 | 0.31 | +1450% ‚úÖ |
| **Sensitivity** | 0.08 | 0.65 | +713% ‚úÖ |
| **Accuracy** | 99.63% | 99.60% | -0.03% (who cares!) |
| **Loss** | 0.19 | 0.32 | Higher but better! |

### Why Loss is Higher:
The loss is higher because the model is actually **trying to detect lesions** now, which is harder than predicting all zeros. This is **good** - it means the model is working!

---

## üéØ Training Phases Explained

### Phase 1: Awakening (Epochs 1-15)
**What happens:** Model realizes lesions exist

```
Dice: 0.08 ‚Üí 0.30
IoU: 0.03 ‚Üí 0.15
```

**Visual:** Predictions go from all black to some faint gray blobs

**What to watch:** 
- ‚úÖ Dice should at least double
- ‚ùå If Dice stays <0.15 after 15 epochs, there's still a problem

### Phase 2: Learning (Epochs 15-40)
**What happens:** Model learns lesion patterns

```
Dice: 0.30 ‚Üí 0.50
IoU: 0.15 ‚Üí 0.35
```

**Visual:** Predictions show clear lesion outlines, some false positives

**What to watch:**
- ‚úÖ Steady improvement each epoch
- ‚úÖ Training and validation curves should be close
- ‚ùå Large gap = overfitting

### Phase 3: Refinement (Epochs 40-70)
**What happens:** Model fine-tunes predictions

```
Dice: 0.50 ‚Üí 0.65
IoU: 0.35 ‚Üí 0.45
```

**Visual:** Predictions match ground truth better, fewer false positives

**What to watch:**
- ‚úÖ Slower improvement (normal)
- ‚úÖ Sensitivity reaches 75%+
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May early-stop if no improvement

### Phase 4: Peak (Epochs 70-100)
**What happens:** Model reaches its limit

```
Dice: 0.65 ‚Üí 0.70
IoU: 0.45 ‚Üí 0.50
```

**Visual:** Minor improvements, predictions are good

**What to watch:**
- ‚úÖ Training should stop or early-stop
- ‚úÖ Save best model based on validation Dice
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't train too long (overfitting risk)

## üö® Warning Signs

### Still Not Working After 20 Epochs

If you see this after 20 epochs:
```
Train Dice: 0.15
Val Dice: 0.12
Sensitivity: 0.25
```

**Action needed:**
1. Increase `FOCAL_ALPHA` to 0.90
2. Increase `FOCAL_GAMMA` to 4.0
3. Restart training

### Overfitting

If you see this:
```
Epoch 40:
  Train Dice: 0.75  ‚Üê High
  Val Dice: 0.45    ‚Üê Much lower
  
  Train Loss: 0.20  ‚Üê Low
  Val Loss: 0.45    ‚Üê Much higher
```

**Action needed:**
1. Stop training (model won't improve)
2. Use best checkpoint (not final)
3. Consider: more data augmentation, lower learning rate

### Model Collapse

If you see this:
```
Epoch 50:
  Train Dice: 0.99  ‚Üê Suspiciously high
  Val Dice: 0.05    ‚Üê Terrible
  Predictions: All white everywhere
```

**Action needed:**
1. Training failed (model broken)
2. Decrease learning rate: `LEARNING_RATE = 5e-5`
3. Restart training

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### Minimum Acceptable Performance:
```
Dice: > 0.50
IoU: > 0.35
Sensitivity: > 0.70
Specificity: > 0.95
```

### Good Performance:
```
Dice: > 0.60
IoU: > 0.45
Sensitivity: > 0.75
Specificity: > 0.95
```

### Excellent Performance:
```
Dice: > 0.70
IoU: > 0.55
Sensitivity: > 0.85
Specificity: > 0.95
```

### State-of-the-Art (Hard to Achieve):
```
Dice: > 0.80
IoU: > 0.70
Sensitivity: > 0.90
Specificity: > 0.95
```

**Note:** For medical MS detection with severe class imbalance, **Dice > 0.60 is considered good!** Don't expect perfection.

## üìà How to Monitor Training

### 1. Watch Terminal Output
Focus on these lines:
```
Val Dice: 0.5200  ‚Üê Most important!
Val IoU: 0.3521   ‚Üê Second important
Sensitivity: 0.7234  ‚Üê Critical for medical
```

### 2. Check Training Plot
```bash
# During training (in another terminal)
watch -n 10 "ls -lh results/training_history.png"

# After an epoch completes, view it
xdg-open results/training_history.png
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ Upward trend in Dice
- ‚úÖ Downward trend in Loss
- ‚úÖ Train/Val curves close together

### 3. Visual Predictions
```bash
# After training finishes
python main.py --mode evaluate
xdg-open results/test_predictions.png
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ White regions where lesions are
- ‚úÖ Predictions roughly match ground truth
- ‚úÖ Clean edges, not too noisy

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be Patient**: With severe class imbalance, improvement is slow at first. Give it 30+ epochs.

2. **Monitor Dice, Not Accuracy**: Accuracy is meaningless. Watch Dice like a hawk.

3. **Check Visual Predictions**: Numbers don't tell the whole story. Look at the actual predictions.

4. **Don't Overtrain**: If validation Dice stops improving for 10 epochs, stop and use best checkpoint.

5. **Save Your Work**: The script automatically backs up old checkpoints. Don't lose your good models!

6. **Compare Before/After**: Keep your old checkpoints to see the improvement.

---

## üéâ You'll Know It's Working When...

After 30-50 epochs:
- ‚úÖ Dice is above 0.50
- ‚úÖ IoU is above 0.35
- ‚úÖ Visual predictions show detected lesions (not all black)
- ‚úÖ Sensitivity is above 0.70
- ‚úÖ Training plots show clear upward trend

**That's success!** üöÄ

The model won't be perfect (medical imaging rarely is), but it will be **actually detecting lesions** instead of predicting all zeros.
